or another example using arms data sourced from STOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL
PEACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE at https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers
This interactive visual illustrates which countries bought arms from the time period of 1950 to 2019.  The size of the colored circles is relative to quantity purchaed.
By drilling down on each data point, the type of arms purchased is revealed.
